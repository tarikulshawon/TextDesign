			<string>Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow.</string>

			<string>The only thing better than having you for parents is my children having you for grandparents.</string>
			<string>A father’s goodness is higher than the mountain. A mother’s goodness deeper than the sea</string>

			<string>A parent’s love is whole no matter how many times divided.</string>
